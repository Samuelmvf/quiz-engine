## About the project üìã

This project is a Quiz Engine developed using React and CSS/SCSS.
The primary goal of the project is to provide a dynamic and interactive platform for
rendering quiz questions sequentially, based on a predefined JSON structure. This engine is designed to enhance user engagement
by supporting various question types and conditional navigation, offering a tailored quiz experience.

#### This APP allows you to:
- Run Dynamic Quizzes: Design quizzes with various question types using a JSON structure. Easily update or modify quizzes without altering the core application logic.
- Engage Users with Diverse Question Types:
    - One-Choice Questions: Provide questions where users select one answer from multiple options.
    - Multiple-Choice Questions: Enable questions where users can choose multiple answers, offering more flexibility and depth in assessments.
    - Input Questions: Include open-ended questions that allow users to input text responses, capturing detailed feedback or answers.
- Navigate Conditionally: Implement conditional logic that allows the quiz to adapt based on user responses. This feature enables personalized quiz paths, enhancing the interactivity and relevance of the quiz experience.
